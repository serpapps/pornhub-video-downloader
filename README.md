This extension allows users to download videos directly from PornHub to their local computer with a single click, making it easy to save and access adult content offline.

### downloads justification  
The "downloads" permission is required to save videos from PornHub directly to the user's computer. Without this, the extension would not be able to transfer video files to the user's local storage.

### activeTab justification  
The "activeTab" permission is necessary to interact with the PornHub website that the user is currently viewing. It enables the extension to detect and download videos only when the user activates the extension on an appropriate tab.

### storage justification  
The "storage" permission is used to save user preferences and extension settings locally. This ensures a smooth and personalized user experience each time the extension is used.

### notifications justification  
The "notifications" permission is used to inform users when a video download has started, completed, or if there is an error during the process. This keeps users updated about the status of their downloads.

### contextMenus justification  
The "contextMenus" permission allows the extension to add options to the right-click menu, making it more convenient for users to download videos directly from the context menu without having to use the main extension popup.

### clipboardRead justification  
The "clipboardRead" permission may be used to allow users to quickly paste PornHub video URLs from their clipboard into the extension for downloading, streamlining the user workflow.

The "tabs" permission is required to access information about the user's open tabs, such as the current URL, to ensure the extension only operates on PornHub video pages and manages downloads efficiently.

### scripting justification

The "webNavigation" permission helps the extension monitor navigation to PornHub video pages, enabling it to offer download functionality only when appropriate.

### Host permission justification
Host permissions are requested for pornhub.com and its subdomains to enable the extension to detect and download videos directly from the PornHub website. No other hosts are accessed.
